# `rgmyr.files`

Cross-platform setup scripts and config files for Unix-like (macOS, Debian) machines, managed with [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io).

Sort of supports WSL - have to manually install `zsh-history-substring-search`, a newer version of `neovim`, there's some hacks to a silence warnings about `zsh` docker completions symlinking, etc. My preference is to use as few Windows machines as possible, so I probably won't put a lot of effort into making it bulletproof.

## How Chezmoi Works

Chezmoi is a dotfile manager that uses templates to adapt configuration files and one-time installation scripts. It detects OS, architecture, and environment, so that you can use appropriate versions of commands, paths, and settings on (potentially) any machine. For example, this repository automatically uses `/opt/homebrew` on Apple Silicon Macs and `/usr/local` on Intel Macs or when running under Rosetta 2.

## My Idea of a Good Time

- **Modern CLI tools** that offer improved versions of traditional Unix commands
    - `exa, bat, ripgrep, fzf, zoxide, yazi` etc.
    - Aliasing certain commands like `ls/ll -> exa, cat -> bat` to always use the improved version
    - Leaving basic `grep` accessible
- **[Base16](https://github.com/RRethy/nvim-base16)** for consistent colors across terminals and easy switching
    - `theme github`: `base16-github-dark-dimmed` (default)
    - `theme solarized`: `base16-solarized-light`
    - `theme rgmyr`: a custom theme, similar to solarized dark but a little easier on the eyes
    - Many other public themes available, see [the project repo](https://github.com/RRethy/nvim-base16).
- **[Neovim](https://neovim.io/)** with [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) for managing plugins, keymaps, and options
    - `jj` to escape from insert mode, `;` to enter command mode 
    - Collection of themes mapped to `<leader>` + `tg, ts, tt, tc` (github, solarized, tokyonight, catppuccin, etc.)
- **Terminal multiplexing** with [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
    - `Ctrl+a` instead of `Ctrl+b` to enter tmux mode
    - `|` and `-` to split panes, rather than `%` and `"`
    - `vim`-style keybindings for pane navigation (`hjkl`) and resizing (`HJKL`)
- **AI-assisted development** 
    - [supermaven](https://github.com/supermaven-ai/supermaven) for fast AI completion in Neovim
    - TBD on agents. Trying: `claude-code`, `cursor-cli`, `gemini-cli`, `aider`

### üñ•Ô∏è tmux (Terminal Multiplexer)

The `tmux server` is a local process that manages:

- multiple ongoing terminal sessions (like an instance of a terminal emulator)
- each with multiple windows (like tabs within a session)
- each having one or more panes arranged in an arbitrary grid
- sessions and windows can be named
- panes can be quickly split, unsplit, and resized

#### Session Management
```bash
# Outside tmux
tmux new -s myproject     # Create named session
tmux ls                   # List all sessions
tmux attach -t myproject  # Attach to existing session
tmux kill-session -t myproject

# Inside tmux (Prefix: Ctrl+a)
Ctrl+a d                  # Detach (keeps session running)
Ctrl+a s                  # Switch between sessions
Ctrl+a $                  # Rename current session
Ctrl+a X                  # Kill current session (with confirmation)
```

#### Window Management
```bash
Ctrl+a c                  # Create new window
Ctrl+a n                  # Next window
Ctrl+a p                  # Previous window
Ctrl+a 0-9                # Switch to window number
Ctrl+a ,                  # Rename window
Ctrl+a &                  # Kill window
Shift+Left/Right          # Switch windows (no prefix needed)
```

#### Pane Management (Split screen)
```bash
Ctrl+a |                  # Split vertically (custom binding)
Ctrl+a -                  # Split horizontally (custom binding)
Ctrl+a h/j/k/l            # Navigate panes (vim-style)
Ctrl+a H/J/K/L            # Resize panes
Ctrl+a z                  # Zoom/unzoom current pane
Ctrl+a x                  # Kill current pane
Ctrl+a Space              # Cycle through pane layouts
```

#### Power User Commands
```bash
Ctrl+a e                  # Synchronize panes (type in all at once)
Ctrl+a r                  # Reload tmux config
Ctrl+a [                  # Enter copy mode (vim-like scrolling)
```

### üîç Advanced File Navigation

#### fzf (Fuzzy Finder)
```bash
Ctrl+r                    # Search command history
Ctrl+t                    # Insert file path at cursor
Alt+c                     # Change to selected directory

# In fzf interface
Tab                       # Multi-select
Shift+Tab                 # Deselect
Enter                     # Confirm selection
Esc                       # Cancel
```

#### fd (Find Files)
```bash
fd pattern                # Find files/directories matching pattern
fd -e py                  # Find only Python files  
fd -t f pattern           # Find only files (not directories)
fd -t d pattern           # Find only directories
fd -H pattern             # Include hidden files
```

#### ripgrep (Search in Files)
```bash
rg "pattern"              # Search for text in all files
rg "pattern" --type js    # Search only in JavaScript files
rg -i "pattern"           # Case-insensitive search
rg -v "pattern"           # Invert match (show lines that don't match)
rg -n "pattern"           # Show line numbers
rg -C 3 "pattern"         # Show 3 lines of context
```

### üìÅ File Management with Yazi
```bash
yazi                      # Open file manager
# Inside yazi:
h/j/k/l                   # Navigate (vim-style)
Enter                     # Open file/directory
q                         # Quit
Space                     # Select/deselect
a                         # Create new file
A                         # Create new directory
d                         # Delete selected
r                         # Rename
y                         # Copy
x                         # Cut
p                         # Paste
```
